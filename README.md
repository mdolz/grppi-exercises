**GrPPI exercises**

This document contains a collection of hands-on exercises about the GrPPI interface, an open source generic and reusable parallel pattern programming interface developed at Univ. Carlos III of Madrid. Basically, GrPPI accommodates a layer between developers and existing parallel programming frameworks targeted to multi-core processors, such as ISO C++ Threads, OpenMP and Intel TBB, and accelerators. The parallel patterns supported by GrPPI are targeted for both stream processing and data-intensive applications and can be composed among them to build more complex constructions.
